# CampusCloset Documentation

## Mission Statement üåé
The market for second-hand, sustainable fashion is growing. Introducing your digital thrift store: CampusCloset is a platform that started as a digital thrift store for university students to swap clothing to other students, fostering a sustainable and economical approach to fashion. The app serves as a platform to reduce waste and promote the recycling of clothing, and allows users to interact with others as well as find recommendations for their closet.

## User Cases
1) Philip (BU student):
- **Need**: Affordable and appropriate attire for a job interview
- **Solution**: Finds a suit through Campus Closet, saving time and money compared to
traditional shopping.

2) Clara (MIT graduate fellow):
- **Need**: Wants to declutter her wardrobe and access a wider variety of clothing
- **Solution**: Waits for the expansion of Campus Closet to participate in swapping clothes.

3) Ethan (Freshman looking to define his college style)
- **Need**: Diverse and affordable clothing options to explore different styles
- **Solution**: Uses Campus Closet to try new styles affordably and sustainably by swapping
clothes instead of buying new ones.

4) Mia (Environmental activist and student)
- **Need**: A platform that aligns with her values of sustainability
- **Solution**: Chooses Campus Closet to reduce fashion waste and promote clothing recycling
among her peers

## Technical Documentation üîß

### Authentication & Data Storage
- **Firebase Realtime Database** is used for secure user login, authentication and data storage,
handling session management and user data efficiently. The database stores: "imageUri", "itemName", "listingId", "tags", "location" and "userEmail" fields with each item.
### Location-Based Services
- **Google Geocaching API** and **Android Location Services** ensure that users can find and
swap clothes within their local area, enhancing the convenience and reducing the carbon
footprint associated with shipping. On the main explore page, we query Firebase by the location tag, and users are only displayed items from their ‚Äúcity.‚Äù
A location permission request pops up once per device, once it‚Äôs accepted, the same device will always have location services enabled for the app.

### Auto-Tagging of Uploaded Images
- **Imagga API** automatically tags uploaded images, simplifying the listing process for users
and enhancing the searchability of items. We used Retrofit to manage network requests. ‚ÄúGarment‚Äù, ‚Äúclothing‚Äù, and ‚Äúapparel‚Äù are common tags the API recognizes so we simply remove them! Included 40% confidence cutoff.

### Search and Discovery Features
- Users can perform detailed searches by tags or titles, utilizing optimized Firebase queries for
fast and relevant results.
### Tinder-Like Swiping Interface
- Implemented using `androidx.cardview.widget.CardView` and Glide, this feature allows users
to quickly browse through clothing options in a fun and engaging way.

## Challenges and Solutions üèîÔ∏è
### Git Version Control
- **Challenges**: Numerous conflicts between commits and difficulties in managing branches.
- **Solutions**: Adopted more rigorous branch management strategies, utilized git stashing and
rebasing to maintain a clean commit history.
### API Integration
- **Challenges**: Initial inaccuracy in tagging from Imagga API, leading to irrelevant tags.
- **Solutions**: Adjusted the confidence thresholds for tags and implemented filters to exclude
common but unhelpful tags.
### Time Management and Debugging
- **Challenges**: Integrating features within the tight timeline of the academic semester proved
challenging, compounded by extensive debugging sessions that were time-consuming.
- **Solutions**: Enhanced planning and time management were employed, along with more
effective debugging practices like systematic logging and using debugging tools more
proficiently.
### User Interface Design
- **Challenges**: Creating an intuitive and appealing user interface that could operate efficiently
across different devices and operating systems.
- **Solutions**: Iterative design improvements through usability testing ensured a more
user-friendly interface.

## Future Directions
- **Feature Enhancements**: Include secure payment options for premium features, develop a
more sophisticated tagging algorithm, and create a personalized explore page.
- **User Experience**: Continuous improvement of the app‚Äôs UX/UI to ensure smooth and
intuitive user interactions.
- **Market Expansion**: Extend the service to include non-students and additional geographical
locations.
