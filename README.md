# CampusCloset (prev. ClothingSwap) ðŸ‘•

## ![Update 2 Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14qpLxy5YtdOUxOJqi4Fe9RQ8DnWlGYTPCk9kaVlaU3I)

## Whatâ€™s our final project?
Campus Closet is a platform for university students to swap, borrow and sell clothing to other students! It will include a social page that allows users to interact with others as well as find recommendations for their closet. 
Who is it for? Have you ever needed a suit before an interview or a dress before a formal, at the last minute? Have you ever felt that you had too many articles collecting dust in your closet? For now we want to test in the University/student ecosystem by validating with .edu emails, but in the future, our app is for any ecoconscious or thrifty user who will find value in a virtual clothing swap.

## What will it do?
Essentially a public database of secondhand clothing that users can offer to swap. An explore page will allow for recommendations with search functionality.
